The model aims to minimize electricity costs and balance supply and demand by considering hourly variations in electricity prices and solar energy availability. We employ a linear programming approach with a robust optimization framework to address uncertainty in electricity prices using the Bertsimasâ€“Sim methodology. The model determines the optimal charging schedule for EVs while satisfying energy requirements, power limits, and grid capacity constraints. It is compared against the traditional First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) strategy. Our results demonstrate over 30% cost savings in the best scenario and reduced grid dependence through the integration of solar energy and risk-aware scheduling, highlighting the potential for sustainable and cost-effective EV charging infrastructure.
